Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
It enables the development of software systems that apply to various fields in the modern day world for example healthcare, entertainment, education and transport among others

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of Programming languages which are used in the development of software systems and applications.
Recognition of Software Engineering as a discipline that enable the growth of the skill among developers and the general public through education and the work ethic.
Development of agile software development methodologies which enabled the efficient development of high quality scalable software systems and applications by developers.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements whereby the user needs and documentation together with the requirements are gathered in order to prepare for the process
Design is the second stage where the software system is designed all the way up from its architecture to its interface.
Implementation is the third stage where the software system is coded all the way up as the code is written to capture all the aspects mentioned in the design process.
Testing is the fundamental step after the build is complete as it is confirmed if the components are working properly and meet all user specific needs and ensure high quality standards
Release is next where the software system is released to the user for usage and application where deemed fit
Maintainance is now the final step whereby the software engineers continue to provide support for the system through providing updates and also fixing problems arisen.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a rigid and sequential process that follows the nature of a waterfall in that one step cannot be done before the other while the agile methodology is a flexible and more efficient process as it enables an iterative approach where feedback and changes to the system are applied at any moment.

Waterfall methodology is best when the software system requirements and user needs are fixed and do not change due to any relevant factors relating to it and less or even no changes are required to be made while the agile method is suitable when the software system is large and the user needs and software requirements do change regularly or just from time to time as the build progresses and opens up for more changes to be done.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - he/she is respomsible for the writing of the base code for the software and its implementation

Quality Assurance Engineer - he/she runs tests to ensure the quality and capability of the software systems to ensure that they meet standards set

Project Manager - Oversees the planning, implementation and execution of software development projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Develop Environments enable a software engineer to write, debug and build the code he/she has written for the software system and prepare it for implementation. One good example is VS Code.

Version Control Systems enable for the monitoring and keeping track of the changes that the specific software system code has undergone and enable collaboration between developers to work on development projects. A good example is GitHub



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Schedules for delivery and/or release - Task prioritization is a good solution as it ensures that the most important task and activities are taken care of.
Changing requirements during development of the software system - Agile methodology application is necessary in this situation due to the nature of its flexibility enabling these changes to be made quickly and almost as effectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing targets only a specific component in the software system and ensures its functionality and quality.

Integration Testing is the testing of the interaction between the various components of the system as they work hand in hand to perform their designated tasks.

System testing focuses on the testing of the entire software application as a whole to ensure that it finally meets the user/customer needs and does not run into problems after release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of providing a large language model with clear, concise and direct instructional input prompts to enable it to provide the desired output as asked by the user.

It is important as it enables us as users to get the desired output by being more clear and concise in our input queries/prompts.
It scales up the quality of data obtained through the large language models in its application in chatbots and virtual assistance across different fields.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Draw an image of a boy
Improved: Draw an image of a a boy, brown skin colour complexion, long hair, of African-American origin, wearing a checkered shirt with denim pants and natural background.

The improved prompt enables me to explain to the large language model in details as to what type of output i require of the boy in question.
